This format uses molecular fingerprints to prepare and search an index of a multi-molecule datafile. It allows fast substructure and structural similarity searching. The indexing is a slow process (~30 minutes for a 250,000 molecule file). The subsequent seaching is much faster, a few seconds, and so can be done interactively.

For more information on using the [FastSearch](/FastSearch "wikilink") index format, see the [user's tutorial](/Tutorial:Fingerprints "wikilink").
