Open Babel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages of chemical data. It's an open, collaborative project allowing anyone to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas.

That means that Open Babel has two main pieces:

-   **[Ready-to-use programs](/Guides "wikilink")** for interconverting, searching, modifying, and analyzing chemical files
-   A **[complete programmer's toolkit](/:Category:Developer "wikilink")** to allow easy chemistry software development

Heredity
--------

In the beginning there was [Babel](http://www.eyesopen.com/babel/), which translated between computational chemistry file formats. And it was useful, liked by many and lived many years. Eventually there was OBabel which never saw the light as a released product. But OBabel lead to [OELib](http://www.eyesopen.com/products/toolkits/oelib.html). This was open and free. OELib has now become Open Babel (C++) and [JOELib](http://joelib.sourceforge.net) (Java) and both will remain open, free, chemical software toolkits.

As for [Open Eye](http://www.eyesopen.com/), they've created a closed, proprietary library similar to Open Babel called [OEChem](http://www.eyesopen.com/products/toolkits/oechem.html).

So maybe it's not an epic story. But it's a continuing one. Open Babel is a community effort -- many thanks to many previous [contributors](/THANKS "wikilink")!
