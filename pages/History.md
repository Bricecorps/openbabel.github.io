In the beginning there was [Babel](http://www.eyesopen.com/babel/). And it was useful, liked by many and lived many years. And eventually there was OBabel which never saw the light of day. And OBabel lead to [OELib](http://www.eyesopen.com/products/toolkits/oelib.html). This was good and open and free. And into this day, what was OELib has become Open Babel (C++) and [JOELib](http://joelib.sourceforge.net) (Java) and both will remain free and open.

So maybe it's not an epic story. But it's a continuing one. Open Babel is a commnunity effort -- many thanks to many previous [contributors](/THANKS "wikilink")!
