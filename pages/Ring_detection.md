Extensive reviews about ring detection algorithms can be found in the work of Lynch et al. ([Article:dghl89a](/Article:dghl89a "wikilink"),[Article:dghl89b](/Article:dghl89b "wikilink")), Gleiss ([PhdThesis:gle01](/PhdThesis:gle01 "wikilink")), and Downs ([Article:dow03](/Article:dow03 "wikilink")).

One of the most often used ring sets in Cheminformatics application is the Smallest Set of Smallest Rings (SSSR) ([Article:fig96](/Article:fig96 "wikilink")). This algorithms is a combination of the breadth first search (BFS) of Balducci ([Article:bp94](/Article:bp94 "wikilink")) and the node elimination procedure of Doucet ([Article:fpdb93](/Article:fpdb93 "wikilink")).
