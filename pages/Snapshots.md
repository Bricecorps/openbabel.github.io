In order to broadly distribute the latest development versions of Open Babel, monthly “snapshots” are made. Because these are made at a particular time, there is absolutely no guarantee that they build or function correctly.

That said, most of the active developers use these latest versions in day-to-day use, so please feel free to try them out and provide feedback to the [openbabel-devel mailing list](mailto:openbabel-devel@lists.sourceforge.net).

Download the latest [code snapshots](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=40728&package_id=154019) here.
