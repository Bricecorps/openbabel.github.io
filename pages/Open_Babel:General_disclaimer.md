**The Open Babel Project cannot make any guarantee or warranty of validity or factuality.**

*The Open Babel Project* at <http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/> is the online home of and the first access point for information about the software [Open Babel](/Main_Page "wikilink"). The community working here is a voluntary association of individuals and groups who are developing an open tool for chemistry and related sciences. The structure of this site, which is a wiki, allows anyone with an Internet connection and World Wide Web browser to alter the content found here. Therefore, please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by professionals with the expertise necessary to provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information.

That is not to say that you will not find valuable and accurate information on `openbabel.sourceforge.net`; much of the time you will. However, we cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here. The content of any given information may recently have been changed, vandalized or altered by someone whose opinion does not correspond with the state of knowledge in the relevant fields.

### No formal peer review

We are working on ways to select and highlight reliable versions of information articles. Our active community of editors uses tools such as the [Special:Recentchanges](/Special:Recentchanges "wikilink") and [Special:Newpages](/Special:Newpages "wikilink") feeds to monitor new and changing content. However, this website is not uniformly peer reviewed; while readers may correct errors or engage in casual review, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever. Even articles that have been vetted by informal review may later have been edited inappropriately, just before you view them.



*None of the authors, contributors, sponsors, administrators, sysops, or anyone else connected with Open Babel in any way whatsoever can be responsible for the appearance of any inaccurate or libelous information or for your use of the information contained in or linked from these web pages.*
