The most important class in Open Babel is [OBMol](/OBMol "wikilink"), or the molecule class. The [OBMol](/OBMol "wikilink") class is designed to store all the basic information associated with a molecule, to make manipulations on the connection table of a molecule facile, and to provide member functions which automatically perceive information about a molecule. A guided tour of the OBMol class is a good place to start.
