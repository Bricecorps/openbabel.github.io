The Open Babel project is extremely proud to announce the release of Open Babel 2.0.0, the latest stable version of the free chemistry file translation program and chemistry software library. This release marks the fourth "birthday" of the Open Babel project and a  milestone for a stable, flexible interface for developers and users alike.

OpenBabel is a project designed to pick up where Babel left off, as a cross-platform program and library designed to interconvert between many file formats used in molecular modeling, computational chemistry and related areas.

Highlights of the 2.0 release include a new conversion framework making it easier to develop new translators, dramatically improved support for merging, splitting, and batch conversion, a framework for molecular fingerprints, similarity searching, a fast molecular database format, support for Perl and Python scripting "wrappers," automatic support for reading .gz (gzip) compressed files, support for the new IUPAC/NIST InChI identifiers and more.

Many thanks to all the contributors to Open Babel. Particular thanks go to (in no particular order) Jean Br√©fort, Nick England, David Hoekman, Elmar Krieger, Christian Laggner, Chris Morley, and Chris Swain for helping to get this release out the door.
