I am very happy to finally announce the release of Open Babel 2.3.1, a major update release of the open source chemistry toolbox.
Open Babel has been downloaded nearly 200,000 times and is used in over 45 projects and over 400 publications.

This release represents a major bug-fix-release and should be a stable upgrade, strongly recommended for all users of Open Babel. Many bugs and enhancements have been added in the last year since the 2.3.0 release.

I'd particularly like to thank Chris Morley, Noel O'Boyle, and many others who put large amounts of time testing and improving this release.
This is a community project and we couldn't have made this release without you. Many thanks to all the contributors to Open Babel including those of you who submitted feedback, bug reports, and code.
