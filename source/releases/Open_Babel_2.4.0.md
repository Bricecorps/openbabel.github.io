I'm pleased to announce that Open Babel 2.4.0 has finally been released.
This release represents a major update and should be a stable upgrade, strongly recommended for all users.

We intend to move to an annual major release every September, with bug fix releases as needed.
A sample of major new features:
- Integration of the confab conformer generator
- Improved partial charge models, including EEM methods, EQeq
- ECFP radial fingerprints
- Initial support for ring rotamer / conformer sampling
- Improved GAFF atom typing and parameterization
- New PHP scripting bindings
- Many new file formats, features and bug fixes
